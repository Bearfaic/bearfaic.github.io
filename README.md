Within this repository are several websites I built for different projects for a Web Programming course.

This one is nice to look at, and doesn't contain any jokes that it would take me a very long time to explain. (None of those jokes are actaully funny, like, one of the websites is for a hypothetical high-concept shoe store that only sold one shoe ever and then closed, because I had to make a website for a business? Sorry. Most of the websites use the same parts, so there's nothing more technically impressive than exercise four.)

A project using node.js is TECHNICALLY hosted here, in a capacity that doesnt work. It's labeled under "final", if you want to look at the code. The project itself, in a working capacity, is here:    https://calm-coast-99386.herokuapp.com/
It's a prisoner's dilemma simulation. From two different computers, (or two different tabs) you sign in with different names, then choose an option from the dropdown, then both players receive a score based on the two inputs.
