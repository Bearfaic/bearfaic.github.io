<p>Knife Dad loves his children very much, and by "children," I mean "knives." His head isn't bad. One thing I want to get in here is that if he sees a knife, he legally owns it. He eats knives for fuel. Not his kid-knives, though. Why's his head look like that? Don't sweat it. He has to keep eating knives to avoid eating his children knives. Knife Dad is Stan Lee. </p>
<p>He [MOVES] like a broken train, but he runs on time, if you know what I mean. He's part wolf, part mech, part rabbit, part fox, part sunglasses, part dragon, part dad, all dad, all knives. If you unbutton his shirt, a bunch of knives will fall out, and then he'll die, because he's just a bunch of knives under there. </p>
