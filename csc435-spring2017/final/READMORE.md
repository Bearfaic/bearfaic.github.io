My project is a representation of the prisoners dilemma. You are a criminal who has been captured by the police. Currently, you and your partner are being interrogated in separate rooms. If neither player confesses, both players get away with no sentence. However, if one player confesses, they get a reduced sentence, and the other player gets an extended one. If both players confess, they both get a moderate sentence.
