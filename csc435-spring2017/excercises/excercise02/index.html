<p>SSWI is a collective of dreamers, artists and visionaries who came to create... Art. Unconstrained by budget, corporate greed, or the schackles of having a "business plan", we produced (1) shoes from April, 2009, to June, 2016, taking the fashion world, as well as the wholesale shoe world, by storm. And then, just as soon as we started, we stopped.</p>
<p>Beyond producing the shoe, SSWI is also responsible for running the worlds first shoe factory. Our lawsuit, to force all other shoe manufacturers to refer to their factories as "shoes" factories is currently under review.</p>
<p>Our third and final business venture is that of a shoe sales/distribution company. We made our first sale in early 2016. Also our last sale. Just the one sale, really.</p>
