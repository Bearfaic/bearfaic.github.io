<h1>Company History</h1>
<p>In early 2009, noted deconstructionist cobbler BCE Stylesworth formed a partenership with Norweign avant-garde semi-businessman AH Degalle, and Chinese historical figure Yang of Sui. There were many naysayers, standing in SSWI's way, who thought things like "you can't have a dead guy on your board of directors", "why are you doing this", and "You borrowed HOW much money"!? But we proved them wrong. </p>
<h1 id=text>Why did we stop?</h1>
