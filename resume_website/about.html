		<h1>I can do anything, and I mean that sincerely. Let me at it.</H1>
		<br>
		I'm a student programmer and entrepreneur. Peviously, I worked at Vertex Inc, where I built solutions to automate regular work in Python, and analyzed databases using SQL to accurately estimate sizing needs of customers. I currently go to school at American university, and expect to graduate in May 2018. I most often work in C++, Java, Python, and C#, but I've dabbled in many other languages, and I learn new languages and tools quickly. I also have some experience with mobile development, APIs, web development (See: this site), and databases. I'm very employable.
