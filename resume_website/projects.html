				Currently, I am creating a custom web streaming application that will be able to:
				<br>
				-Play video, and act as a normal video player
				<br>
				-Pause the video, and play a second video
				<br>
				-During the second video, skipping/trackbar will be disabled
				<br>
				-Return to the first video, and restore the trackbar
				<br>
				<br>
				The idea behind this app is that it would act as a player which would play advertisements, but with the ads hosted on site, so as not to be picked up by ad blocking software.
